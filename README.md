# CustomShell
Developed a custom shell that allows user to change their directory
-Lists the contents of the current directory such as available files etc
-Mimics the behavior of current shell that is available on windows and mac
-Keeps track of the history commands
-Allows users to delete any words from the command written and much more.

-Please download the ashell.cpp file from this repo and run the following commands:
- g++ ashell.cpp
- ./ashell
- Now shell should be running, type in "pwd" to test the shell
